# ReHuman

ReHuman is civic infrastructure for care, time and real-world support.

## The problem

Care keeps society alive — childcare, cooking for someone recovering from surgery, helping an elderly neighbor get to an appointment, sitting with someone in crisis — but this work is invisible, unpaid, and unsupported.

Families, single parents, elderly people, migrants, and caregivers are burning out. There is no trusted, shared system for asking for help and receiving it with dignity.

## The core idea

1 hour of care = 1 hour of value.

When you help someone (watch their child for 2 hours, cook meals, drive them to the hospital, give emotional support), that time is recorded.

You build a reputation for helping.  
Later, when *you* need support, you can ask the community and you are not alone.

This is not “charity.” It’s reciprocity, memory, and trust.

## What we are building

- A simple way for people to offer help (“I can cook”, “I can pick you up”, “I can stay with your dad for 2 hours so you can rest”).
- A way for people to ask for help safely and without shame.
- A transparent log of hours given and hours received.
- A trust / reputation layer, so communities can coordinate support quickly and responsibly.

## Why this matters

We want to make care visible and respected as infrastructure — not just emotional labor that disappears.

ReHuman is designed as a public good:
- local-first,
- community-driven,
- culturally adaptable,
- accountable.

## Pilot

We are preparing a live pilot in Buenos Aires with real families and caregivers.  
Goal: prove the basic loop (ask → match → help → record) in real life.

## What we need

We are looking for:
- builders who care about social impact,
- reputation / identity / attestations,
- safe community tooling,
- and human-centered design.

If you want to collaborate, reach out.
